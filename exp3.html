        <p>The rose is a type of flowering shrub. 
            Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.
            The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes 
            white or purple rose.Roses can be seen very much in gardens.Sometimes they can be in vineyards as well.In a big vineyard, 
            a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers 
            can see that their vines are healthy as well.</p>
